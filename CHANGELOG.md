## 2020-11-25-01

* Migrated my old triangulator program over to this library. It does some pretty cool stuff, I originally wrote it so that I could plot out the boundary lines of my yard. I haven't gotten around to that part but the program is pretty cool. Namespace is TRIANGULATOR_NAMESPACE.
* Migrated changelog documentation over to this file. Well, did not so much migrate as just started a new unified changelog and put a note describing where to find the old change logs.
* Created a README.md file.

## 2020-11-27-01

* Moved documentation over from my old table processor program into the TABLE_PROCESSOR namespace directory.
* Brought over some old serial coms work. Gonna work on improving it. SERIAL_COMS_NAMESPACE is where its contained.
