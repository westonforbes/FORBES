CHANGELOG

2020-10-15-01 - First complete, stable package.

2020-10-19-01 - Changed how RESET_LOG() does resets. Previously it invoked .Reset() method but that caused weird issues with rebinding the DGV on forms, so
				I just changed it so that the thread manually goes through each row and deletes it. Its probably a bit slower but its function is more predictable to me.

2020-10-23-01 - Broke this logger library into its own library rather than a copy-n-paste class.
				Added in CONSOLE_VERBOSE public int which sets the verbose level for the console output. This was in a prototype version but it got lost in development.

2020-10-23-02 - Added readonly modifier to LOG.
				Made reserved strings (ENTER, EXIT_FAIL, etc) public so they may be modified as the user likes.
				Removed the reserve string "BLANK" and changed it to "". Why I had it that way in the first place...dunno what I was thinking.

2020-11-02-01 - Migrated logger into FORBES library suite. Managing a bunch of different .dlls was getting annoying. Will start bring more stuff over here.

2020-11-03-01 - Added a unified (static) log so that we can see all logs for a given program.
				
				Added a LOG_RESET event which is raised when the log clears itself, if this is raised without the method RESET_LOG being called, 
				its because overflow protection was triggered.

				Added static ALL_LOGS_RESET event, same as LOG_RESET but applies to the static member. This launches the EventHandler method ALL_LOGS_RESET_EVENT in each instance
				of the class so that they may clear their own logs.

				Added two new columns to the log, Log Name and Shared Log Entry ID. This makes differentiating which class generated the message easier.

				Changed the constructor so now a friendly log name is required for initialization.

				Added method RESET_ALL_LOGS, which as the name implies, resets all logs.

2020-11-10-01 - Migrated documentation over to xml so that it may be viewed in Object Browser.
				
				Changed event ALL_LOGS_RESET to public event.
